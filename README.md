# Battle-Ship
This was a mid-term project for my Intro Programming 1 class. This was the first real time I spent countless hours getting it to run the way I wanted too. Lot's of time googling and asking ChatGPT for help. In the end I was very proud of myself for my hard work (Defenitely not pressured by a deadline...)
